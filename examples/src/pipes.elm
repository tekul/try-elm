{- You will often end up calling a bunch of functions in a row.
Maybe something like this:
-}
weirdReversal1 string =
  String.filter isNotSpace (String.toUpper (String.reverse string))


{- Elm has the pipe operator (|>) that lets you write the same
exact function in a different way.

Think of the pipe as feeding a value into the next function. In
this case, we feed the string into reverse, then into toUpper,
then we filter out any spaces.
