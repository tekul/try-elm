The examples from the original try.elm-lang.org site updated for Elm 0.19.

This is a cut-down version of the original site which provides the compiler API and code editor without any of the additional elm-lang.org content. A lot of the code is taken from https://github.com/elm/elm-lang.org with minor changes and as such is copyright the original authors.
